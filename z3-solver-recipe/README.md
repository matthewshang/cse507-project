Failed attempt at building a Conda package for `z3-solver` so it could be installed in an environment. We could definitely get this working but I'm too lazy for now (short term ideal solution would be writing a script that installs from the PyPi wheel (instead of building from source as that requires Visual Studio C/C++ toolchains which is annoying)).
